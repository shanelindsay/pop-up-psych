# Portable Psychology & Neuroscience Demonstrations

A grab-and-go handbook of illusions, cognitive challenges and bio-sensor demos you can run on a table-top stand, in a classroom or at a science-fair booth. Each activity needs minimal kit, fits in a 5-minute slot, and links directly to a core concept in mind/brain science.
