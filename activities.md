# Summary of Science Activities
This guide gathers grab-and-go psychology and neuroscience demonstrations for science fairs, open days, and classroom visits. Our principles are simple: spark curiosity, get everyone doing, not just watching, and then ground the wow-factor in rock-solid research. Each activity is safe, low-cost, and connects a striking illusion or measurement to a core idea about how minds and brains work in everyday life.

Our approach is three pronged:
1.	Invite them to take part
2.	Do the activity 
3.	Hit them with science

# Portable EEG Brain Wave Detection (≈5 min, 1 participant, ★★☆)

## Background
A portable EEG recorder's sensors detect the spontaneous activity of neurons in your brain. Your brain generates electrical frequencies that are detected using electroencephalography (EEG) sensors along the surface of the scalp.

The medical community has used EEG technology since the early 1920s. However, recent advances in sensor technology now make it possible to offer EEG in an easy-to-use and mobile form.

## The System
The system consists of a small wearable headband which can be paired with a smartphone, tablet or PC. The wearable headband can be put on like a pair of glasses. Unlike more large-scale EEG systems used for research, no gel has to be applied in order to use the device.  Remove long hair that may prevent contact with the skin behind the ears or on the forehead.
 
## What does the system measure?
The device detects a full range of brainwave activity. Brainwaves are typically broken up into five bands, and the device detects all five:
*	Delta waves, which are most present during sleep.
*	Theta waves, which are associated with sleep, very deep relaxation, and visualization.
*	Alpha waves, which occur when relaxed and calm.
*	Beta waves, which occur when, for example, actively thinking or problem-solving.
*	Gamma waves, which occur when involved in higher mental activity and consolidation of information.

## Can the device read my mind?
No. The device can only tell the type of brain activity you're experiencing, not what you're thinking about.

## Setting up the EEG Recorder
Make sure the display device (e.g., tablet or smartphone) and the EEG recorder are fully charged before/after events. This guide assumes you are using a display device with compatible software installed. 
 
1. Turn on the EEG headband by pressing the power button. 
2. Go to the display device's Bluetooth settings and connect to the EEG device.
3. Start the compatible monitoring app. 

If this doesn't work you may need to go to Bluetooth setting on the display device and manually connect to the EEG headband.

## Activities with the EEG Recorder
When the app is running, you should see a continuous recording from several EEG channels, typically from the forehead and behind the ears. The app should also provide an indicator of signal quality for each channel. 

### Jaw Clench
Try clenching your jaws. Since not only neurons but also muscle cells trigger electrical changes, this will result in visible electrical activity in the EEG (a high-frequency component). Next, try clenching just one side of your teeth. 

**Activity:** One person clenches their jaw, and the audience has to guess by looking at the EEG whether the person is doing (a) a full jaw clench, (b) a left jaw clench, or (c) a right jaw clench. When recording EEG for research purposes, the experimenter usually tries to avoid participants making jaw clenches because it can mask the signal of interest. This "noise" from muscles is called an artifact, and this activity is a great example of why researchers need to use "artifact rejection" techniques to clean their data.

### Eye Blinks and Movements
Blink your eye. You will see large spikes of electrical changes in the EEG, triggered by the muscle activity underlying an eye blink. Now try moving your eyes from left to right, and then from right to left. 

**Activity:** Can you tell the direction of the eye movement (left to right or right to left) based on the EEG? (Hint: Look at the channels corresponding to the left and right forehead). Like the jaw clench, eye movements are another common artifact that must be removed from research data.

### Alpha Waves
Observe your brain going into rest mode. Close your eyes for 10 seconds, relax, and try not to move your eyeballs. This will cause an increase in Alpha activity. An observer looking at the channels (especially those behind the ears) should see that an additional low-frequency component is now present. When people are very tired, Alpha is more pronounced. As soon as you open your eyes, the Alpha amplitude will be reduced. 

**Activity:** Try to guess whether someone has their eyes open or closed based on the EEG.

To correct for this, your brain uses adaptive plasticity, updating its internal model of how movement relates to the world. This involves the cerebellum and brain areas involved in vision and motor control.
First studied in the 19th century (Stratton, 1896), this is a classic demonstration of how flexible our brains can be — a key idea in cognitive and developmental psychology. The principles of this adaptation are relevant to real-world applications, such as training for visuomotor rehabilitation in patients recovering from a stroke or brain injury.

## Try This
*	How many tries before you can accurately touch the target?
*	Is your second go easier than your first?
*	Why might some people adapt faster than others?

# Upside-Down Goggles Activity (≈3 min, 1 participant, ★★☆)

## Requirements
*	1 pair of upside-down (vertical-inverting) prism goggles
*	A visible target (e.g. the top of a pen, someone's finger)
*	Chair for participant to sit
*	Mirror or phone camera for observers (optional)

## Activity
1.	Put on the goggles. They flip the world upside-down — everything appears vertically reversed.
2.	Touch the target. Try to touch the top of a pen or someone's finger in front of you. Most people initially miss or move the wrong way.
3.	Try again. With a few attempts, you'll likely improve. Your brain is starting to adapt.
4.	Let others try. Keep each turn short (1–2 minutes) so others can have a go. Always supervise.

## Explanation
This task shows sensorimotor adaptation — how the brain adjusts movement when sensory input changes. The goggles reverse what you see, creating a conflict between vision and movement.

# Spiral After-Effect Illusion (≈2 min, any group, ★☆☆)

## Requirements
*	Electric drill and spiral attachment
*	2 drills are ideal. 
*	Charge where possible as this gets a lot of use, so charge during quiet periods.

## Instructions
Tell your volunteer that you are going to expand their mind. Hold a handheld electric screwdriver with a spiral pattern in front of their face and keep it spinning. Get everyone else to stare at the centre of the spinning disc as you slowly count to 20. The closer to their face the better, as it will fill more of their field of vision. On 20 move the disc away from their face. If people continue to stare at the volunteers head they will see it appear to expand. The pattern can be reversed so that objects appear to shrink. Looking at back of their hands, or around the room, can also produce unusual effects. 

## Explanation
This is a classic visual illusion, which relies on a phenomenon called motion after-effect. After staring at a waterfall - or a similar moving-yet-static object such as a rotating spiral - anything you look at afterwards will appear to be in motion in the opposite direction.
A rotating spiral appears to be expanding or contracting depending on the direction of rotation. If you stare at the spiral and then avert your eyes, a stationary object will appear to be moving in the opposite rotation. This happens because in the visual nervous system there are cells that respond to specific directions of motion. So, when a person looks at an object moving downward such as a waterfall, that person's downward receptors are in action. Let's say he stares at the downward motion long enough for those cells to become fatigued and then looks at a stationary object, like the grassy hill. The grass will appear to be moving upwards. The upward receptors compensate for the fatigue of the downward receptors. This phenomenon is known as an after effect.

# Hybrid Image Illusion (Einstein/Marilyn) (≈1 min, any group, ★☆☆)

## Requirements
*	Einstein/Marilyn hybrid poster

## Instructions
Ask people to walk away from or towards the poster, seeing what happens and if the face changes. Alternatively, they can stand still while you move the poster. Asking people to remove glasses or squint will change the distance needed for the illusion to work. 

## Explanation
A hybrid image is an image that is perceived in one of two different ways, depending on viewing distance, based on the way humans process visual input. Hybrid images combine the low spatial frequencies of one picture with the high spatial frequencies of another picture, producing an image with an interpretation that changes with viewing distance.
Perhaps the most familiar example is one featuring Albert Einstein and Marilyn Monroe. Looking at the picture from a short distance, one can see a sharp image of Einstein, with only a hint of blurry distortion hinting at the presence of an overlaid image. Viewed from a distance in which the fine detail blurs, the unmistakable face of Monroe emerges.

An accompanying poster can show the separate high and low detail images that are combined to make the single face. 

# Hollow Face Illusion (≈2 min, any group, ★☆☆)

## Requirements
*	Hollow face mask on a stand

## Instructions
Ask people to watch the face as it rotates. It is a very powerful illusion and everyone should experience it. Ask them to watch and pay attention to the point where it flips round, and how the illusion suddenly disappears. The illusion works best if the participants move their heads (e.g. walk in parallel in front of the face). 

## Explanation
According to Richard Gregory, "The strong visual bias of favouring seeing a hollow mask as a normal convex (facing outwards) face is evidence for the power of top-down knowledge for vision". This bias of seeing faces as convex is so strong it counters competing monocular depth cues, such as shading and shadows, and also very considerable unambiguous information from the two eyes signalling stereoscopically that the object is hollow. 
Scientists have attempted to explain the illusion for centuries, but there is still much we don't know about how it works. Our visual system can use tools like binocular disparity and motion parallax to judge distance, but these techniques don't seem to work with the hollow mask until we're extremely close to it: for many people, nearer than three feet. The effect is diminished if the mask is turned upside-down, but it doesn't disappear; nearly everyone still sees the illusion.
All this adds up to a fairly convincing argument that our perception of a face as a whole is what causes us to see the mask as convex, like a real face instead of a hollow shell. Our visual system is receiving a variety of different cues to depth of objects, and prioritizes them in ways that are usually quite accurate. But illusions such as the hollow face demonstrate that those priorities don't always work. Fortunately we don't see hollow masks nearly as often as real faces, so for the vast majority of our visual experience, our visual world seems just fine.

# The Schema Mismatch Task (≈2 min, any group, ★☆☆)

## Requirements
*	A selection of identical-looking jelly beans (e.g. from Beanboozled or similar)
*	Small paper cups or napkins
*	Bin for discarding
*	Water for rinsing (optional)

## Activity
1.	Choose a jelly bean (without knowing its flavour).
2.	Predict the taste. What do you expect, based on its colour or smell?
3.	Eat it!
4.	Reflect:
    *	Was the taste what you expected?
    *	How did your brain and body react if it wasn't?
    *	Would you choose that colour again?

Facilitators can ask:
*	"What made you expect that taste?"
*	"How quickly did you realise it didn't match?"
*	"Did it make you trust your expectation less?"

## Explanation: What Are Schemas?
Schemas are mental frameworks built from past experiences. They help us predict what things are, how they behave, and what to expect next. For example, seeing a red jelly bean might trigger a schema for "strawberry" or "cherry" based on previous sweets.
But if it turns out to taste like chilli or soap, your prediction is violated — that's called a prediction error. This experience prompts your brain to re-evaluate its assumptions and, over time, update the schema.
This kind of mismatch is central to how we learn, adapt, and make sense of the world. It's the same principle that underlies how children learn new word meanings, how adults change habits, and how we revise stereotypes.

# McGurk Effect (≈2 min, any group, ★☆☆)

## Requirements
*	TV /laptop/phone screen
*	Video of the McGurk effect (e.g. with three faces) on a loop
*	Speakers or headphones 

## Instructions
Easiest case is have a video of person repeating sylablle "ba" - ask them to shut eyes before hearing it, and say what they hear. Then they should look at the screen and it is repeated, and again report what they now hear. 

## Explanation
The McGurk effect is a perceptual phenomenon that demonstrates an interaction between hearing and vision in speech perception. The illusion occurs when the auditory component of one sound is paired with the visual component of another sound, leading to the perception of a third sound. The visual information a person gets from seeing a person speak changes the way they hear the sound. People who are used to watching dubbed movies may be among people who are not susceptible to the McGurk effect because they have, to some extent, learned to ignore the information they are getting from the mouths of the "speakers". If a person is getting poor quality auditory information but good quality visual information, they may be more likely to experience the McGurk effect. Integration abilities for audio and visual information may also influence whether a person will experience the effect. People who are better at sensory integration have been shown to be more susceptible to the effect. Many people are affected differently by the McGurk effect based on many factors, including brain damage and other disorders.

# Rubber Hand Illusion (≈5 min, 1 participant, ★★☆)

## Requirements
*	Rubber hand
*	Table
*	2 chairs
*	Divider/screen to hide the real hand
*	Two identical paintbrushes or pens
*	Hammer (optional, for dramatic effect)

## Instructions
1.  The participant sits at a table and places both hands on it, palms down.
2.  Use the divider to hide their real hand (e.g., their right hand) from their view.
3.  Place the rubber hand on the table in a plausible position, where their real hand would be.
4.  Use two paintbrushes to stroke the participant's hidden real hand and the visible rubber hand in the same location, at the same time and speed.
5.  After about a minute of simultaneous stroking, switch to only stroking the rubber hand.
6.  Ask the participant if they can still feel the sensation in their hidden hand.
7.  (Optional) Pretend to hit the rubber hand with a hammer and observe if the participant flinches or pulls their real hand away.

## Explanation
A trick known as the rubber hand illusion plays with this sense of body ownership. In this illusion, a subject is made to believe a rubber hand is in fact his own hand, which is hidden from view, to the point of pulling his own hand away if the rubber hand is attacked. 
When Botvinick and Cohen first demonstrated the illusion, they argued that vision is crucial for identifying one's body. You see where your hands and feet are as much, if not more, than you feel where they are. We see objects that move with us or that we move as being part of us. The cool thing is that the boundary between the self I perceive and the world around me is malleable. I can see a rubber hand as being my hand, as being part of my body, as part of me.

# Skin Conductance (Stress Detection) (≈4 min, 1 participant, ★★☆)

## Instructions
When holding the device, ensure the fingers on the same hand are not touching each other.

## Activity
Ask the volunteer to take part in two activities during the session:
1.	**Mildly Stressful Scenario**
    Have the volunteer describe a mildly anxiety-provoking event (e.g., taking an exam). Prompt them to reflect on how it feels — racing heart, dry mouth, nervousness, etc. Guide them through this scenario for about 1 minute. The device should flash RED to indicate heightened arousal.
2.	**Relaxing Scenario**
    Ask the volunteer to describe a personally relaxing situation (e.g., a quiet morning walk or having tea indoors on a rainy day). Encourage visualisation of the calming features of the scenario. Guide them to breathe slowly — roughly one breath cycle per second — saying "breathe in" and "breathe out" calmly. Repeat intermittently over 2–3 minutes. Ideally, the device will flash GREEN to indicate relaxation. A WHITE light (no change) is also acceptable, as sweat levels take time to decrease.

This order ensures the session ends with a calming experience. As an optional comparison, you can have the volunteer try mental arithmetic (like counting backwards from 100 in steps of 7) or imagine something exciting (like a rollercoaster) to see how different mental states affect the reading.

## Explanation
The device measures electrodermal activity — changes in the skin's electrical conductance linked to sweat gland activity, which increases under stress. This is a measure of sympathetic nervous system activity.
Psychologists use this data to explore individual stress responses, evaluate stress-reducing strategies, and investigate why some people recover from stress faster than others. This research spans areas such as Biological, Health, Occupational, and Clinical Psychology, which the demonstrator can briefly explain based on interest.

# Thaumatropes (≈2 min, any group, ★☆☆)

## Requirements
*	Card/paper
*	Glue/tape
*	BBQ skewers or string

## Explanation
The Thaumatrope is a Victorian toy constructed from a simple disk or card featuring a different picture on each side and attached to two pieces of string or a skewer. When the strings are twirled rapidly (or the skewer is spun between the hands), the card rotates on its axis and the two images appear to blend into one due to the persistence of vision.

# The Stroop Effect (≈5 min, any group, ★☆☆)

## Requirements
*	Two word lists printed on a poster board:
    *	List 1: Colour names printed in matching ink (e.g., "RED" in red ink).
    *	List 2: Colour names printed in non-matching ink (e.g., "RED" in blue ink).
*	Stopwatch
*	Leaderboard (e.g., whiteboard or large paper) and pens/post-it notes.

## Activity
1.  Participants first read the matching list (List 1) as quickly as possible. This is for practice.
2.  Next, they are timed reading the second, non-matching list (List 2). The task is to name the *colour of the ink*, not read the word itself.
3.  Time their performance and deduct time for any mistakes.
4.  Record their name and time on the leaderboard.

An alternative is to have one list and first ask them to read the words, then on a second go, ask them to name the ink colours.

## Explanation
The Stroop effect demonstrates the interference in reaction time of a task. When the name of a color (e.g., "blue", "green", or "red") is printed in a color which is not denoted by the name (e.g., the word "red" printed in blue ink instead of red ink), naming the color of the word takes longer and is more prone to errors than when the color of the ink matches the name of the color. This is because reading is an automatic process for most adults, and it interferes with the less-practiced task of naming a colour. This highlights the concepts of automaticity and cognitive control. It's also worth noting that individual differences exist: younger children or neurodivergent individuals may show different patterns of interference.

# Semantic Priming (≈2 min, any group, ★☆☆)

## Activity
Tell people you are going to ask a question and they should respond as quickly as possible. Then ask one of the following sets of questions:

**Set 1:**
1. What is a word spelling S-H-O-P?
2. What do you do when you come to a green light? (Many will say "Stop" instead of "Go").

**Set 2:**
1. What colour is snow? (White)
2. How do you spell SILK? (S-I-L-K)
3. What do cows drink? (Many will say "Milk" instead of "Water").

**Set 3:**
1. How do you spell GHOST? (G-H-O-S-T)
2. What do you put in a toaster? (Many will say "Toast" instead of "Bread").

**Set 4:**
1.  Say the word BORK ten times…
2.  What do you eat soup with? (Many will say "Folk" instead of "Spoon").

## Explanation
Semantic priming is a phenomenon in which exposure to one stimulus (the prime) influences a response to a subsequent stimulus (the target). In these examples, the priming questions or words activate related concepts in the brain, making an incorrect but related answer more accessible and likely to be said, especially when under pressure to answer quickly.

See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bx7Vl6klmw) for a demonstration.

# Corsi Block-Tapping Task (≈4 min, 1 participant, ★★☆)

## Requirements
*	Corsi board (9 wooden blocks affixed in irregular order and numbered on the examiner's side)
*	Table and two chairs facing each other
*	Recording sheet or spreadsheet for scores
*	Optional: stopwatch to pace taps (≈1 s per block)

## Activity
1.	The examiner sits opposite the participant. The participant cannot see the numbers on the blocks.
2.	The examiner taps a sequence of blocks, starting with a two-block sequence, at a pace of about one tap per second.
3.	The participant must immediately repeat the sequence by tapping the same blocks in the same order.
4.	If correct, the examiner presents a new sequence that is one block longer.
5.	If the participant makes an error, the examiner repeats the same sequence one more time.
6.	The test stops when the participant fails to reproduce a sequence of a certain length twice.
7.	The "Corsi span" is the highest sequence length the participant reproduced correctly.

## Explanation
The task measures visuo-spatial short-term memory and is a standard assessment of working-memory capacity (Corsi, 1972). Most adults can reproduce a sequence of five to six blocks; recalling nine or more is uncommon (Kessels & de Wal, 2010). Using comparable pacing and block placement is important to ensure reliability. 

### Example Sequences (ascending length)
*   **2 blocks:** 2-8
*   **3 blocks:** 9-6-5
*   **4 blocks:** 7-2-4-5
*   **5 blocks:** 1-9-3-6-7
*   **6 blocks:** 3-4-8-7-2-6
*   **7 blocks:** 9-3-5-7-4-9-8
*   **8 blocks:** 3-8-7-5-3-2-5-9
*   **9 blocks:** 7-4-2-7-0-9-4-3-5
*   **10 blocks:** 1-8-5-7-3-9-6-4-2-8

# Size-Weight Illusion (≈2 min, any group, ★☆☆)

## Requirements
*	Three containers of different sizes but with mismatched weights (e.g., a large light container, a small heavy one, and a medium one with another weight).
*	A sign with the activity title.
*	Optional: a weighing scale for participants to check the actual weights after they have guessed.

## Activity
1.  Ask participants to lift each of the containers and guess their relative weights.
2.  Most people will perceive the larger container to be heavier than the smaller one, even if the small one is actually heavier. This is the illusion.
3.  After they have lifted them and made a judgment, they can use the weighing scale to see the actual weights.

## Explanation
The size-weight illusion, also known as the Charpentier illusion, is a cognitive illusion where, when a person lifts two objects of equal weight but different sizes, they will typically feel that the smaller object is heavier. The expectation is that the larger object will be heavier, and when this is not the case, the brain misinterprets the sensory feedback.

# Afterimage Illusion (≈2 min, any group, ★☆☆)

## Requirements
*	A t-shirt with a bright, single-colour fish on it (e.g., blue or green). A printed card also works.
*	A white background (like a wall, or a piece of paper/card with a simple fishbowl drawn on it).

## Activity
1.  Get everyone to stare at the fish on the t-shirt or card for about 20-30 seconds. Encourage them to focus on a central point, like the eye of the fish.
2.  After the time is up, tell them to quickly look at the white background (or at the fishbowl).
3.  They should see a ghostly "afterimage" of the fish in a different colour.

## Explanation
White light is made up of all colours of the spectrum. Our eyes have colour receptors (cones) for red, blue, and green light. Staring at a single bright colour (like a blue fish) fatigues the receptors for that colour. When you then look at a white background, the fatigued receptors (blue in this case) don't respond as strongly. The remaining receptors (red and green) are still fresh and fire normally. The brain combines the signals from the red and green receptors, and you perceive the complementary colour (yellow/orange).

# Buzz Wire Task (≈3 min, any group, ★★☆)

## Requirements
* Buzz wire device
* Timer (optional)

## Activity
1. Move the loop steadily from one end of the bent wire to the other, aiming for the fewest possible buzzes.
2. To add competition, time each attempt and **add 5 seconds for every buzz**. Compare adjusted times to see who has the steadiest hand.

## Explanation
Electric and non-electric versions of the buzz wire game are familiar party toys, but the task is also used in occupational therapy and motor-skill research. Guiding the loop demands fine hand–eye coordination, focused attention, patience, and rapid error recovery. Clinicians adapt the set-up to track progress in patients with motor impairments, and engineers use it as a haptic training exercise for surgeons and drone pilots.

# Tower of Hanoi (≈5 min, 1 participant, ★★☆)

## Requirements
*	A Tower of Hanoi puzzle set (typically 3 pegs and 3-7 disks of varying sizes).

## Activity
1.	Set up the puzzle with all disks on the starting peg, in size order, with the largest at the bottom.
2.	The objective is to move the entire stack to the destination peg.
3.	Follow these simple rules:
    *	Only one disk can be moved at a time.
    *	A disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
    *	No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
4.	Challenge participants to solve it. For a greater challenge, time them or count their moves.Start with 3, for the easiest challenge, then build up. 

## Explanation
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle that demonstrates the power of recursive thinking and is used by psychologists to study problem-solving and planning abilities.

The solution can be found by breaking the problem down into smaller, simpler sub-problems. To move 'n' disks from a source peg to a target peg:
1.  Move 'n-1' disks from the source to the auxiliary peg.
2.  Move the largest (nth) disk from the source to the target peg.
3.  Move the 'n-1' disks from the auxiliary to the target peg.

This recursive strategy shows how a complex goal can be achieved by repeating a simple set of steps. The minimum number of moves required is 2^n - 1, where 'n' is the number of disks. This exponential growth highlights how problem complexity can increase rapidly. The task requires forward planning and working memory to keep track of goals and sub-goals.

# Train Track Illusion (Jastrow Illusion) (≈1 min, any group, ★☆☆)

## Requirements
*	Two identical curved wooden toy train track pieces.

## Activity
1.	Place the two identical track pieces on a table, one slightly above the other, with their curved edges aligned.
2.	Ask participants which piece looks longer. Most people will perceive the bottom piece as being longer.
3.	Swap the positions of the two pieces. The piece that now appears at the bottom will seem longer.
4.	Place one piece directly on top of the other to demonstrate that they are exactly the same size.

Or you can hold in front of them and swap round the postitions. 

## Explanation
This is a classic optical illusion known as the Jastrow illusion. The brain is tricked by the arrangement of the two shapes. Two identical curved pieces look different in size because your visual system judges length using nearby edges and context rather than measuring the whole shapes. The long outer curve of the lower piece sits beside the short inner curve of the upper piece, and this local comparison biases perception so the lower one appears longer. Slight misalignment of endpoints prevents easy matching across the whole contour, which strengthens the effect. It's a powerful demonstration of how our brain uses context and comparison to judge size, and how these shortcuts can sometimes lead to incorrect conclusions.
